Biography:
=====
Simon Tarboush is currently a research consultant at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) ([Information System Lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/isl/about-isl) and [Communication Theory Lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ctl), supervised by [Prof. Tareq Al-Naffouri](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/isl/people/person/tareq-al-naffouri) and [Prof. Mohamed-Slim Alouini](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ctl/people/person/mohamed-slim-alouini)), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

He earned both a B.Sc. in Communication Engineering and an M.Sc. in Radio and Mobile Communication Systems from [Higher Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology (HIAST)](https://hiast.edu.sy/en), Damascus, Syria.

His research interests include signal processing, algorithm design, channel modeling and estimation, low-complexity data detection, practical measurements in the terahertz band, and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to wireless communications.

About me:
=====
I'm a passionate researcher and experienced educator in wireless communications, with a particular focus on terahertz communications, channel modeling, estimation, data detection, and waveform design.

I highly value reproducible research and make an effort to provide simulation codes for my published papers on platforms like GitHub or Code Ocean. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about my codes. I've also been involved in professional service as a referee for various IEEE journals.

I'm also skilled in MATLAB, C, Python, and big data tools. I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers, educators, and professionals in the field of wireless communications. Let's collaborate and explore possibilities in wireless technology and research.

What is new:
=====
**2023.8:**  Moved to Dubai, UAE.\
**2021.10:**  Our work is accepted by **IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology**: "[TeraMIMO: A Channel Simulator for Wideband Ultra-Massive MIMO Terahertz Communications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9591285)."
